           <h2>the introduction:</h2>
            </div>
             <div class="introduction">
              <p>At Naqra, we don't like long introductions, so we'll get straight to the point. This is an unconventional article, intended for non-programmers; It</p>
               <p>is directed to every person who is interested in entering the world of programming, but does not know how, or to any student coming to university, who does not know</p>
                <p>if the programming and computers major suits him. This article will cover the most frequently asked questions in the world of programming, starting with what</p>
                 <p>programming is, what are the programming paths and its specialization, leading to how to learn it, methods of earning through it, and finally with how to know if the </p>
                  <p> programming specialization suits you. Now, without further ado, let's start with the first point.</p>
                   </div>
                    <div class=" programming">
                      <h2>What is programming?</h2>
                       <p>If we want to talk a little technically, programming is defined as the process of writing instructions and commands for electronic devices such as computers and telephones, in</p>
                         <p> order to make them achieve a specific goal. But let us ignore the formal definitions; Simply put, programming is writing codes in special languages ​​known as "programming</p>
                          <p> languages", in order to create a program that performs the function required of it by the programmer, such as developing a chat program, a website for watching movies, or</p>
                           <p> even a car racing game.All computers or smart devices are capable of performing these tasks, but they need someone to explain to them in a language they understand what is</p>
                            <p> required of them. Here comes the role of the programmer: Programming languages ​​are languages ​​that can be automatically converted into a language that computers </p>
                             <p>understand, but they are precise languages ​​and require detail. For example, you can't tell your phone to give you a calculator program. You design the interface, and tell the</p>
                              <p> computer exactly what to do when the user presses each button. The computer (here we mean any electronic device that processes information, such as a computer, phone,</p>
                               <p> PlayStation, and other devices) does not think. The programmer is the one who sets up the way the program works (the so-called algorithm), and the computer literally</p>
                                <p> implements it.</p>
                                  </div>
                                  <div class=" programming-paths">
                                <h2>What are programming paths?</h2>
                              <p>Now that you know the meaning of programming, the second point in your journey is to determine the path in which you will specialize. It should be noted that a good</p>
                             <p> programmer must have a general idea about all paths, but his specialization must be in one path, which he gives all his time to master. There are several sub-tracks in</p>
                           <p> programming, but the basic tracks can be divided into 4 general;tracks, which are</p> 
                          <p>1- Website development</p>   
                         <p>2- Smart phone application development</p> 
                        <p>3- Games development</p>   
                      <p>4- Desktop software development</p> 
                    <p>Let us explain in detail each of these tracks</p>         
                  </div>
                   <div class="p-1">
                    <h2>1- Website development path</h2>
                     <p>It is one of the most popular majors in the Arab world, and the reason is its relative ease of entry by those who are not academically educated in programming, in addition to</p>
                     <p> the great demand for websites at the present time. This path is divided into two sub-paths, Front-End and Back-End. The Front-End means the part of the site that users interact </p>
                     <p>with. Anything from the components of the site that you can see and interactwith, such as texts, buttons, fonts, colors, images, animations, and other things that the user sees</p>
                     <p> and interacts with. Simply put, everything that appears in front of you on the screen when you enter any website is part of Front End. The languages ​​used in Front End are</p>
                     <p> HTML, CSS, and Javascript. But mastering these languages ​​is not enough, as the front-end developer must have a technical vision and experience with UX and UI (i.e. experience</p>
                     <p> with use and interface design, respectively) in order for the site to be beautiful, and at the same time easy to use by visitors and users. As for the Back-End, which may also be</p>
                     <p> called Server-Side, it means the part that is built to connect the pages visible to the user and the various data and applications. In other words, it is the part that is executed</p>
                     <p> and read by the server and is concerned with verifying that data is received and sent correctly to and from the browser. Of course, this part of the code does not appear on the</p>
                     <p> browser, but its results appear. For example, if you access the login page on any website, the username and password fields are through the front end. But the verification</p>
                     <p> process that occurs, which verifies whether the password is correct, occurs via back-end. There are many languages ​​used in backends, the most famous of which are PHP,</p>
                     <p> Python, Ruby, Java, and MySQL for databases. It should be noted here that to achieve faster and better results, working environments belonging to the aforementioned</p>
                     <p> languages ​​are used, which facilitate the development process for the programmer. The most famous of these environments is PHP's Laravel environment.A detailed article</p>
                     <p> about this development environment through this article from Click .There is also what is known as a full-stack developer. This is the programmer who has great experience in </p>
                     <p>both previous branches, meaning that he can develop an entire website on his own. Of course, if you have enough experience to master the two branches, this is excellent. But</p>
                     <p> in the beginning, focus all your focus on one path only. Each of these paths is very deep, and it will take you a long time (maybe years) to master it professionally. So do not get</p>
                     <p> distracted, and focus on only one, while learning the basics of the second path. That is, if you choose to work as a back-end developer, knowing the basics of HTML is a must,</p>
                     <p> and the opposite is true for a front-end developer.</p>
                     </div>
                     <div class="p-2">
                      <h2>2- Smart phone application development path</h2>
                       <p>As the name indicates, specialists in this field work on developing applications for smartphones such as Android and iPhone. If you choose this path, you will be able to develop</p>
                       <p> applications in various fields, such as web applications (linked to websites or servers in general, such as the Facebook application), or practical applications, such as</p>
                       <p> applications for learning a specific language, or a smart alarm clock application. The profit through this path can be very high, even if the application is simple from a</p>
                       <p> programming perspective. The important thing is that the application is unique and there is demand for it. The Alarmy app, for example, which is an alarm clock app that asks</p>
                       <p> you to complete something before you can turn off the alarm (such as solving math problems or moving the phone quickly for a minute, for example), has received tens of</p>
                       <p> millions of downloads. The problem with this path is that the market is very competitive. According to the Statista website for statisticsMore than 6,000 applications are</p>
                       <p> published daily on the Google Store for Android. This means that your application is a drop in a sea of ​​applications, all trying to compete for success. So if you decide to enter</p>
                       <p> this field, and your first application fails, do not despair, and learn from the experience. In order to enter this path, you must learn the following languages: For Android, the</p>
                       <p> most famous language is Java, by working on Android Studio. You can also use C# by using the Xamarin framework. You can learn about the strength and effectiveness of the</p>
                       <p> C# language by reading this article.Python, C++, and C also give you the opportunity to develop Android applications, but they are not recommended. Java is the best choice.</p>
                       <p> But if you want to program applications for iPhone and iPad, there is no real alternative to Swift. A very powerful language that will enable you to develop the application you</p>
                       <p> want. The problem with developing applications for Apple products is that you need a Mac to program them. There are ways to use Swift on Windows, but they are just</p>
                       <p> complicated solutions that do not give excellent results, so if you do not have a Mac, or no one close to you does, reconsider the topic of</p>

                        <h2>3- Games development path</h2>
                         <p>My personal favorite track. No matter how much I talk about this path, I will not do it justice, in my opinion, as I will need to write an entire article about it (I may do this in the</p>
                         <p> future). Unlike other paths, this path gives you complete freedom to pour all your imagination into your project. The only obstacle in front of you is your ability to program.</p>
                         <p> What is also special about it is that the results are immediate. This means that when you write any code, or learn something new, you can see the harvest of your labor directly </p>
                         <p>in the game you are developing. The disadvantage of this path is its extreme weakness in the Arab world. The number of semi-successful Arab game development studios can</p>
                         <p> be counted on the fingers of one hand. Developing a high-level game (or what is known as AAA) requires years of work and a lot of professional developers. Therefore, your</p>
                         <p> chances of succeeding in this path, and earning enough from it to live, may be impossible (and I will not say impossible). We will talk more about how to profit from this field</p>
                         <p> later in this article. If you want to enter the world of game development, you must learn one of the famous game engines. Large companies develop their own engine from </p>
                         <p>scratch, but this requires years and great programming experience, so learning to use a ready-made engine is definitely better. You can develop a game without using an </p>
                         <p>engine, but you will be forced to program everything from scratch, such as physics and other things. So don't reinvent the wheel, use a ready-made engine to buy yourself time</p>
                         <p> and save yourself from useless effort. The most popular engines are Unity, Unreal Engine, and Godot. Personally, I recommend Godot for several reasons The most popular</p>
                         <p> engines are Unity, Unreal Engine, and Godot. Personally, I recommend Godot for several reasons The most popular engines are Unity, Unreal Engine, and Godot. Personally, I</p>
                         <p> recommend Godot for several reasonsWe mentioned it in this article . The Unity engine uses the C# language, the Unreal engine uses C++, and the Godot engine enables you to</p>
                         <p> program using either C#, GDScript, which is very similar to Python, or C++, although the latter is not recommended for other than some specific matters. It is worth noting in</p>
                         <p> this topic that developing complex 3D games requires you to have knowledge of some mathematical fields, such as space and vectors and linear algebra, in addition to basic</p>
                         <p> algebra of course, as is the case with all programming fields.</p>

                          <h2>4- Desktop software development path</h2>
                          <p>This is perhaps the most complicated and involved path, given the vast difference in what "desktop software" means. Photoshop, anti-virus software, and a simple accounting</p>
                          <p> program for a store are all considered desktop programs. But if we want to look at the cup half full, we see that with the many results, you as a programmer also have many</p>
                          <p> options for programming this type of program. Almost any language that allows you to develop for the desktop. Java, Python, C, C++, C#, and even web languages ​​such as</p>
                          <p> HTML, CSS, and Javascript, by using the Electron.js work environment, enables you to achieve what you want. These are the most popular paths, especially in the Arab world,</p>
                          <p> but there are many other specializations such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, and database and network administrators. These are all paths that we will talk.</p>
                          </div>
                           <div class="learn-programming">
                            <h2>How do I learn programming?</h2>
                            <p>Today, there are two beliefs that we in Naqra try to combat as much as possible: The first belief is that technology is a specialty and not general knowledge. This is a huge</p>
                            <p> mistake! Just as mathematics and arithmetic are considered general knowledge, and not just for numeracy specialists, technological knowledge also must be general</p>
                            <p> knowledge, because of our great use of it in our daily lives. Did you know that the famous General Electric Company, for example, obligated all of its employees (even those</p>
                            <p> working in the sales department) to learn the basics of programming? The goal of this is not to learn programming as a job, but to learn programming logic . Therefore,</p>
                            <p> whatever your specialty, try to learn one programming language, and focus on algorithms. The second belief is that programming is an academic study and cannot be learned</p>
                            <p> individually. We want to inform you, dear reader, that the front-end and back-end developers on this site have gained all their experience through self-learning from books, the </p>
                            <p>Internet, and others. It is true that learning programming through a university is much better, but learning programming without a university is of course possible. You don't</p>
                            <p> believe me yet? Ask Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook ; Let's return to our topic. You choose the path you want to learn. What then? Now you have two options. If you are of</p>
                            <p> an age or condition that allows you to enter university, this is of course the best option. Enter university with a major in computers or programming. But if it is too late (or not</p>
                            <p> yet) for you to enter university, then self-learning is your way to enter the world of programming. When we talk about self-learning, there are two methods. Either video courses,</p>
                            <p> or books. It comes down to the person's preference. Regarding videos, there are hundreds of excellent courses. Unfortunately, the Arabic courses are not of a very high</p>
                            <p> standard. English courses are much better. But in any case, if your English is not strong, you can find the most popular Arabic courses on the following YouTube channels:New</p>
                            <p> Baghdad , Osama Al- Zero, Hassouna Academy . As for foreign sources, there are a number of excellent free channels, the best of which we mention: TheNewBoston</p>
                            <p> FreeCodeCamp Brackeys. There are also a number of sites dedicated to courses, some free and some paid. We mentioned the 5 most famous ones in this article . If you prefer</p>
                            <p> books more, there is a treasure trove of free programming books on the “Programming Library” website.</p>

                         <h2>How to profit from programming?</h2>
                        <p>The question that comes to everyone's mind when thinking about learning programming: Is there enough profit to live from programming alone? When we talk about this topic,</p>
                        <p> we will leave corporate jobs aside, and focus on earning as a freelance programmer. The reason is that job opportunities in companies vary widely from one country to another,</p>
                        <p> and even within one country, and according to the experiences and certificates that the programmer possesses, and whether they are required in the labor market in which he</p>
                        <p> lives. Therefore, when you address an Arab audience spread over 22 countries, discussing this topic will be futile. So let's think about freelancing: Is it profitable? In terms of</p>
                        <p> platforms specialized in this field, the Arab world is extremely poor in this topic. The only platform through which you can earn well is the “Mustaqal” platform.. It is a platform </p>
                        <p>that allows programmers to offer their services, gives them the opportunity to meet clients for their projects, and acts as an intermediary that guarantees the rights of the</p>
                        <p> programmer and the client alike. But due to the lack of other platforms, the competition is very intense. But of course, the professional will prove himself no matter how</p>
                        <p> intense the competition is. Aside from business platforms, you can also sell your projects privately. Opening an electronic company to develop projects via the Internet, and</p>
                        <p> advertising them on social media sites, is also possible. It will take you a lot of effort and effort in order to reach customers, but in the end, if you want to achieve great</p>
                        <p> success, your effort must also be great. The last method that we will talk about for making money through programming is advertisements, whether they are on your website</p>
                        <p> or on your applications and games. You can develop a site that attracts visitors, such as an article site, for example, and place ads from AdSense, for example, on it. If you can </p>
                        <p>get a large number of visitors, you can earn thousands of dollars a month from it. Or even in applications and games on the phone; For example, the famous Flappy Bird game</p>
                        <p> was earning more than $50,000 a day due to advertisements (Source from Forbes ), despite the fact that the game is very simple from a programming perspective, as you can</p>
                        <p> learn to develop a similar game in less than a week! What made this game earn this impressive number of profits for a simple game developed by one person in his free time is</p>
                        <p> that it is a new, simple and entertaining game. So take this example as a lesson for you: what is important is not the complexity, but the idea is the foundation.</p>

                            <p>We have reached the conclusion of our article, so as a result, you want to know if programming is right for you. The answer is simple: When you read this article, did you feel</p>
                            <p> excited to learn programming? If your answer is “yes,” then working as a programmer may be suitable for you, but there are still several conditions that you must meet: Can</p>
                            <p> you work on the computer for several hours straight without getting bored? Working as a programmer will require you to work on your project for long hours of your day, up to</p>
                            <p> 10 hours. If sitting in one place does not suit you, then you should rethink whether programming is really the right field for you. In any case, we advise you to try it first before</p>
                            <p>> taking any fateful step (such as changing your university major). What we recommend is learning the basics of C++ online. Give yourself a week or two, and solve the exercises</p>
                            <p> as much as possible, by using sites such as HackerRank.. If after this period you feel that you want to learn more, you will know that this specialty is for you. If you feel bored,</p>
                            <p> or if you are even able to finish the course, unfortunately, I do not think programming is right for you. If you have any questions or inquiries, do not hesitate to post your</p>
                            <p> question on the Nogra website , where specialists will answer you as quickly as possible to solve all your problems.</p>
